// Merge Sort optimized alogorithm important
// Time Complexity: O(n log n)
// merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.
// It is a comparison-based algorithm that focuses on how to merge together two pre-sorted arrays such that the resulting array is also sorted.
